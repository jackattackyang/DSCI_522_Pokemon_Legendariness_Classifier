## Intro


### Proposal Question
We are interested in what are the top strongest indicators that determines whether a Pokemon is legendary.  
This question is **Predictive** as we are using existing Pokemon data to assess the attributes that are most indicative of a legendary Pokemon

### Procedure

#### Data Retrieval
We used the following python script to retrieve the [Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) from Kaggle

#### Data Cleaning
We dropped "Generation" and "Total" 

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
The following barplot explores the dataset and gives us some intuition of what proportion of Pokemon is actually legendary. 
```{r eda bar1, fig.cap='Figure 1: Pokemon Count'}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "EDA_pokemonCount.png"))

```


We are most curious in determining whether there is a relationship between Pokemon attributes and the legendary status.


Lastly, we also want to see whether there is favoritism for legendary Pokemon across different types.


#### Analysis
We used the decision tree classifier in Python's sklearn. We fed in stats of Pokemon including: type, attack, health... etc. as features. After fitting the data, object attribute feature_importances_ returned an array of the gini score reduction of each feature. The top  features with the highest values answer our question.

#### Results


From our analysis, we found "Sp. Atk", "Attack", "Speed" and "HP" to have the greatest impact on determining the legendary status of Pokemon. Types, as it turned out, have very little influence. 

These top attributes, however, are greatly dependent on the set random state. After many iterations, we found "Sp. Atk" and "Attack" to consistently have high importance.

#### Limitations and Time Considerations

With our current knowledge level, between decision trees and KNN, we were more comfortable with classifying categorical and numerical variables using decision trees. However, we cannot say whether decision trees is better than KNN. A problem we encountered using decision trees is that it is dependent on random states for tie breaking. It is difficult to conclusively state the exact combination of top predictors as they vary at times. KNN does not have this error. These two may also not be the best method for our question. Our views may change in a few weeks from now with more techniques learned in 571.

Another limitation with this analysis is the psedo-legendaries where Pokemon with high stats are still considered non-legendary. So in this case, our classifier would wrongly classify a normal Pokemon as a legendary, eg. 

With more time avilable, we would test likely mis-classifications such as the case mentioned above to better fine tune our classifier.
