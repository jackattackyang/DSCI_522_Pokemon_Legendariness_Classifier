## Intro


### Proposal Question
We are interested in what are the top strongest indicators that determines whether a Pokemon is legendary.  
This question is **Predictive** as we are using existing Pokemon data to assess the attributes that are most indicative of a legendary Pokemon

### Procedure

#### Data Retrieval
We downloaded the [Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) from Kaggle and used the respective read csv calls from R and Python.

#### Data Cleaning
We dropped "Generation" and "Total" from our set of features. "Total" was dropped as it was not an independent variable, it was in fact fully dependent on all of the other stat variables, therefore it made no significant difference to our results. "Generation" was dropped as number of legendaries varies between generations and we did not want the generation to influence our decision tree.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

The following barplot explores the dataset and gives us some intuition of what proportion of Pokemon is actually legendary.

```{r eda bar1}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "EDA_pokemonCount.png"))

```

Figure 1: Pokemon Count

As we can see, less than 10 percent of Pokemon are legendary. This is actually a little more than expected.

We are most curious in determining whether there is a relationship between Pokemon attributes and the legendary status.

```{r eda box2}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "EDA_pokemonFeatureComparison.png"))

```

Figure 2: Pokemon Feature Comparison

We can see that indeed, legendary Pokemon tend to have higher stats compared to regular Pokemon.

Lastly, we also want to see whether there is favoritism for legendary Pokemon across different types.

```{r eda bar3}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "EDA_pokemonTypeComparison.png"))

```

Figure 3: Pokemon Type Comparison

It turns out "Flying", "Dragon" and "Psychic" types seem to take up a disproportionate number of all legendaries, given their representation. We would expect these types to play a role as legendary predictors.

#### Analysis
We used the decision tree classifier in Python's sklearn. We split our data into a features set that included stats and type of Pokemon, and a target set that included the Pokemon's legendary status. Type attributes (categorical variables) for the Pokemon were split into columns containing dummy variables due to the shortcomings of the `sklearn` implmentation of decision trees. The `DecisionTreeClassifier` was then used to generate our model. We optimized our hyper parameter (depth) by conducting cross validation. After selecting the most optimal depth, we refitted the entire dataset. The object attribute `feature_importances_` returned an array of the gini score reduction of each feature. The features with the highest values answer our question.

#### Results

From our analysis, we found "Sp. Atk", "Attack", "Speed" and "HP" to have the greatest impact on determining the legendary status of Pokemon. Types, as it turned out, had no influence, which was very surprising.


```{r ECHO=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
important_features = read_csv(here::here("results", "DecisionTree_important_features.csv"))
knitr::kable(important_features[,2:3])
```

#### Limitations and Time Considerations

With our current knowledge level, between decision trees and KNN (k neartest neighbors), we were more comfortable with classifying categorical and numerical variables using decision trees. However, we cannot say whether decision trees is better than KNN. These two may also not be the best method for our question. Our views may change in a few weeks from now with more techniques learned in 571.

An interesting insight that we did not make use of in our analysis is the fact that many legendary Pokemon are classified as "Genderless", therefore if we were to add another feature to our dataset, it may give us another good indicator.

Another limitation with this analysis is the "pseudo-legendary", a Pokemon with high stats that is not considered legendary. So in this case, our classifier would wrongly classify a normal Pokemon as a legendary.

With more time avilable, we would test likely mis-classifications, add a "Gender" feature and attempt to improve the score of our model by identifying better features.
