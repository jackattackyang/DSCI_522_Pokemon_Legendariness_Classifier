Introduction
------------

This report documents our usage of a Pokemon stat dataset and `sklearn`'s `DecisionTreeClassifier` to find the strongest indicators of a Pokemon's legendary status.

Pokemon is a popular franchise including games, TV shows and trading cards where trainers battle their Pokemon verses other trainers with the ultimate goal to "Catch 'em All". Our dataset was created using statistics from the Pokemon handheld games published by Nintendo which classifies Pokemon based on stats (Attack, Defence, etc.) and Type (Bug, Flying, Fire, etc.).

Proposal Question
-----------------

We are interested in the strongest indicators that determine whether a Pokemon is legendary. This question is **Predictive** as we are using existing Pokemon data to assess the attributes that are most indicative of a legendary Pokemon.

Procedure
---------

### Data Retrieval

We downloaded the [Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) from Kaggle and used the respective `read_csv` calls from R and Python.

### Data Cleaning

We dropped "Generation" and "Total" from our set of features. "Total" was dropped as it is a sum of all other stat variables and is not independent, therefore it made no significant contribution to our results. "Generation" was dropped as number of legendaries varies between generations and we did not want the generation to influence our decision tree.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The following barplot explores the dataset and gives us some intuition of what proportion of Pokemon is actually legendary.

Figure 1: Pokemon Count

As we can see, less than 10 percent of Pokemon are legendary. This is actually a little more than expected.

We are most curious in determining whether there is a relationship between Pokemon attributes and the legendary status.

Figure 2: Pokemon Feature Comparison

We can see that indeed, legendary Pokemon tend to have higher stats compared to regular Pokemon. Lastly, we wanted to see whether there is any favoritism for legendary Pokemon across different types.

Figure 3: Pokemon Type Comparison

"Flying", "Dragon" and "Psychic" types seem to take up a disproportionate number of all legendaries, given their representation. We would expect these types to play a role as legendary predictors.

### Analysis

We used the decision tree classifier in Python's sklearn. We split our data into a features set that included stats and type of Pokemon, and a target set that included the Pokemon's legendary status. Type attributes (categorical variables) for the Pokemon were split into columns containing dummy variables due to the shortcomings of the `sklearn` implementation of decision trees. The `DecisionTreeClassifier` with a balanced weighting between the Legendaries and non-Legendaries was then used to generate our model. We optimized our hyper parameter (depth) by conducting cross validation. After selecting the most optimal depth, we refitted the entire dataset. The object attribute `feature_importances_` returned an array of the gini score reduction of each feature. The features with the highest values answered our question.

### Results

From our analysis, we found "Sp. Atk", "Attack", "Sp. Def" have the greatest impact on determining the legendary status of Pokemon. Looking back at our EDA we can see that "Sp. Atk" was the most outstanding feature between non-legendary and legendary Pokemon so it makes sense that this was chosen as the most important feature. Types had no influence, which was surprising based on our EDA.

Update Milestone 2:

By listening to the issues brought up by our peers, we balanced out our dataset and found a mucher wider range of features that are strong predictors. We found "Sp. Atk", "Sp. Def", "Attack", "Speed" and "Defense" to all have some impact on prediction. "Type 1 Rock" and "HP" are very minor predictors. This was a very important issue that was addressed in our original problem where our tree achieved maximum test accuracy at depth 2. This made sense as not balancing our original data results in the classifer to have a heavy bias towards classifying non-Legendaries, thereby creating very shallow trees.

Table 2: Feature Importances

| Feature      |  Importance|
|:-------------|-----------:|
| Sp. Atk      |        0.45|
| Sp. Def      |        0.18|
| Attack       |        0.14|
| Speed        |        0.10|
| Defense      |        0.05|
| Type 1\_Rock |        0.02|
| HP           |        0.02|

### Limitations and Time Considerations

With our current knowledge level, between decision trees and KNN (k nearest neighbors), we were more comfortable with classifying categorical and numerical variables using decision trees. However, we cannot say whether decision trees is better than KNN. These two may also not be the best method for our question. Our views may change in a few weeks from now with more techniques learned in Supervised Learning. An interesting insight that we did not make use of in our analysis is the fact that many legendary Pokemon are classified as "Genderless". This feature seems like a good indicator and warrants some exploration with more time given to this study. Another limitation with this analysis is the "pseudo-legendary", a Pokemon with high stats that is not considered legendary. So in this case, our classifier would wrongly classify a normal Pokemon as a legendary.

With more time available, we would like to test likely mis-classifications, add a "Gender" feature and attempt to improve our model by by identifying better features.
